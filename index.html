								<p>Sushi Match is a basic card memory matching game with a Japanese sushi theme. There is an easy, medium and hard mode with an increasing amount of cards that the player has to match. I designed a simple menu screen, game screen, game over and high score screens using illustrator.  There are 18 different sushi pieces that randomly change for each game.  A text box at the bottom pops up with the name of the sushi in Japanese so the player also learns at the same time while having fun.  </p>

								<p>Node Web Toolkit is an open source javascript library.  I created the logo and incorporated a newt since the acronym of the product would be pronounced as “newt”.  Initially, I created wireframes and then used those to create the homepage, documentation screen and chat screen.  </p>

								<p>Thinking with Type are typography assignments that I created IN my graphic design class.  For the image on the left we had to overlap a letter or number, one in black and the other in white, to create a unique image without distorting the letter or number form while also keeping it recognizable. For the one on the right, I had to use different size type to make an image. In both of these assignments, I had to think of type not as words but as images, observing the shapes and piecing them together to make a whole.  </p>

								<p>Get There is a design class assignment that focused on urban development.  I created a billboard advertisement to promote the use of public transportation within the San Francisco Bay Area. I wanted the audience to get the idea that the Clipper card is efficient since you can use it to ride the three modes of transportation in the region to go to and from San Francisco.</p>

								<p>I created a sushi boat for my beginning Illustrator class’ final project. I had created sushi pieces for Om Nom Nation and decided that I could use those images and place them on a sushi boat that you would see in a Japanese sushi restaurant. I took what I had learned from that semester, such as using gradients, layers, etc to create this final project.  </p>

								<p>In Om Nom Nation, you play as a chef roaming around the island of Om Nom.  The player builds up their character and wins in game currency, or “golden crumbs”, by defeating food enemies by eating them.  The player can use the golden crumbs to buy items in the store, such as clothes, utensil weapons, etc. to make their journey to becoming the Master Chef a breeze.  I created the main character, clothing, enemy food pieces, utensil weapons, and also the character inventory and store screen.  </p>

								<p>Barkada means a group of friends in tagalog.  I took the sun from the Filipino flag and stretched it to create an elegant crest like design.  </p>

								<p>The food truck is for an isometric simulation game.  I used an isometric grid and placed it on it’s own layer which I used as a base for drawing all the objects of the food truck.  </p>
