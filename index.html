									<h1>Kana Drop</h1>
									<h2>Mobile Game Design, Game Graphics</h2>
									<p class="description">Kana Drop is a mobile language learning game that teaches students Japanese characters and words.</p>
									<p>I designed the menu, game and results screens as well as the beginning tutorial and graphics.  As someone who was learning Japanese before, I thought to create a game that would be simple yet fun to play while at the same time learn Japanese characters.  It’s a great game to supplement Japanese learning.</p>

									<h2>Mobile Game Design, Game Graphics</h2>
									<p class="description">Sushi Match is a basic card memory matching game with a Japanese sushi twist.</p>
									<p>I designed a simple menu screen, game screen, game over and high score screens using Illustrator. There are 18 different sushi pieces that randomly change for each game. A text box at the bottom pops up with the name of the sushi in Japanese so the player also learns at the same time while having fun.</p>

									<h1>Get There</h1>
									<h2>Graphic Ad Design</h2>
									<p class="description">Get There is a design class assignment that focused on urban development.</p>
									<p>I created a billboard advertisement to promote the use of public transportation within the San Francisco Bay Area. I wanted the audience to get the idea that the Clipper card is efficient since you can use it to ride the three modes of transportation in the region to go to and from San Francisco.</p>

									<h1>Thinking with Type</h1>
									<h2>Typography</h2>
									<p class="description">Thinking with Type are typography assignments that I created in my graphic design class.</p>
									<p>For the image on the left we had to overlap a letter or number, one in black and the other in white, to create a unique image without distorting the letter or number form while also keeping it recognizable.</p>
									<p>For the one on the right, I had to use different size type to make an image. In both of these assignments, I had to think of type not as words but as images, observing the shapes and piecing them together to make a whole.</p>
